# Insolar Observer node
Insolar Observer node (later "the Node") allows trusted agents such as crypto exchanges collect record data produced by Insolar smart contracts, organize it into a SQL database, and aggregate various statistical data.

Trusted agents can integrate the Node into their business applications or use the Node API to get the data at their discretion.

The Node communicates with Insolar Platform via gRPC and obtains data from a trusted Heavy Material Node run on Insolar Platform. 

Access to the Heavy Material Node is controlled by an Insolar authentication service and is limited to registered trusted agents.
This mechanism is designed to protect the Node users against inaccurate or corrupted data. 

Meanwhile, the Node users are responsible for the data they store locally on their Node instance and can regulate local access via an access control system of their choice.

To use Insolar Observer node, you need to:

1. Install prerequisites
2. Obtain an authorized access to Insolar Platform.
3. Build, deploy and monitor Insolar Observer node on the hardware of your choice.

# Install the prerequisites

1. Install and set up [PostgreSQL 11.4](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).

2. Install and set up [Go Tools 1.12](https://golang.org/doc/install).

3. Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

# Obtain an authorized access to Insolar Platform

The Node users need to obtain an authorized access, otherwise they are not able to address the trusted Heavy Material Node on Insolar Platform or to collect the data. 

To obtain it:
1. [Contact Insolar Team](https://insolar.io/contact) to register as a trusted agent.
2. After the registration, the Team will send you your login along with a unique link to set your password. The link doesn't have a common Web UI and should be addressed via a CLI tool such as Curl.
3. Set your password using the link. Consider this command as the reference example: 
   ```
   curl -d '{"login":"your_login", "password":"password_of_your_choice"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST https://<api-url>/auth/set-password?code=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
   ```
   The correct expected result is to see no errors returned by Curl.
4. After setting your password, put your login and password into the `/.artifacts/observer.yaml` configuration file (see **Build binaries**).
   Working with Insolar Platform, your Node instance uses your credentials from `observer.yaml` to obtain an access token to successfully communicate with the Platform.

# Build

1. Clone the Observer and change to its directory: `git clone git@github.com:insolar/observer.git && cd observer`.

2. Build binaries automatically using the instructions from the Makefile: `make all-node`.

    This command generates:
    * Three necessary configuration files (`migrate.yaml`, `observer.yaml`, `observerapi.yaml`) and places them into the hidden `./.artifacts` directory.
    * Thee binaries (`migrate`, `observer`, `api`) and places them into `./.bin/migrate`, `./.bin/observer`, `./bin/api` respectively.

    **Warning:** The Observer uses Go modules. You may need to set the [Go modules environment variable](https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Module_support) to `on`: `GO111MODULE=on`.

# Deploy

1. Initialize your PostgreSQL database.

2. Configure and deploy the Node.

3. Configure and deploy the Node API.

4. Deploy the monitoring system.

## Initialize your PostgreSQL database

Migrate the necessary database and tables into your PostgreSQL instance: `make migrate-init`.

**Tip**: `migrate-init` is only for the initial database setting-up. Later if needed, you should use `./bin/migrate --dir=scripts/migrations --init --config=.artifacts/migrate.yaml` for updating the database structure.

## Configure and deploy the Node

1. To configure, edit the configuration parameters in `./.artifacts/observer.yaml`:

   * Insolar network address and user credentials to access it in the `auth` section:
   `url: https://<api-url>/auth/token`
   `login: "<your_login>"`
   `password: "<your_password"`.

   * Log parameters in the `log` section:
   ```
     level: debug
     format: text
     outputtype: stderr
     outputparams:
     buffer: 0
   ```
   For the full list of parameters and their description, check [Configuration parameters](https://github.com/insolar/observer/wiki/Configuration-parameters).
   
   **Tip:** You can override all parameters in `observer.yaml` via environment variables that start with `OBSERVER` and use `_` as a separator. For example, `OBSERVER_DB_URL=...` or `OBSERVER_REPLICATOR_LISTEN=...`.

   **Warning:** Overriding via ENV variables works only with the configuration file in place. The configuration file must have the default number of parameters.
   
2. Make sure the `observer.yaml` configuration file is in the `./.artifacts` directory.

3. Run the Node: ```./bin/observer --config .artifacts/observer.yaml```.

   Wait for a while for it to sync with the trusted HMN. 
   
   **Tip:** initial synching can take up to 20 hours as Insolar Platform has a lot of data.

#### Configure and deploy the Observer API

1. To configure, edit the configuration parameters in `./.artifacts/observerapi.yaml`:

   * API endpoint:
   `listen: 127.0.0.1:5678 or listen: :5678`.

   * Database connection in the `db` section:
   `url: postgres://user:password@host/db_name?sslmode=disable`.

   * Maximum number of connections to the database: 
   `poolsize: 20`.

   * Log params in the `log` section:
   ```
    level: debug
    format: json
    outputtype: stderr
    outputparams: ""
    buffer: 0
   ```
   For the full list of parameters and their description, check [Configuration parameters](https://github.com/insolar/observer/wiki/Configuration-parameters).
   
   **Tip**: You can override all parameters in `observerapi.yaml` via environment variables that start with `OBSERVERAPI` and use `_` as a separator. For example, `OBSERVERAPI_DB_URL=...` or `OBSERVERAPI_LISTEN=...`.

   **Warning**: overriding via ENV variables works only with the configuration file in place with the default number of parameters.

3. Run the Node API: ```./bin/api --config .artifacts/observerapi.yaml```.

#### Deploy the monitoring system

1. Make sure you've installed [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/ "Install Compose ").

2. Choose to deploy the built-in or a customized monitoring system as described below.

##### Built-in monitoring system

To deploy the built-in monitoring system, execute the script: 
```./scripts/monitor/monitor.sh```

`monitor.sh` starts Grafana and Prometheus configured for the Node at:

* Grafana: `http://localhost:3000` with the default login and password: `admin` and `pass` respectively. Grafana starts with a preset dashboard. To navigate to the dashboard, use the left menu: `Dashboards > Manage > Observer`.
 
* Prometheus: `http://localhost:9090/graph`

* The Node metrics: `http://localhost:8888/metrics`. The port is set via the `listen` parameter in `./.artifacts/observer.yaml` and `:8888` is the default value.
 
* The Node health check service: `http://localhost:8888/healthcheck`. The port is set via the `listen` parameter in `./.artifacts/observer.yaml` and `:8888` is the default value.

##### Ð¡ustomized monitoring system

To deploy a customized monitoring system:

1. Deploy [Grafana](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/installation/ "Install Grafana ") and [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/installation/ "Install Prometheus ").

   You can get the config for Prometheus [here](https://github.com/insolar/observer/blob/master/scripts/monitor/prometheus/prometheus.yaml).

2. Import [this Grafana dashboard](https://github.com/insolar/observer/blob/master/scripts/monitor/grafana/dashboards/observer.json) into Grafana or create your own. 
 
   If you need to, [read how to import a dashboard]( https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/reference/export_import/).
